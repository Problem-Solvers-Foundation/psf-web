                  <div class="space-y-4 text-black/60 dark:text-white/60 leading-relaxed">
                    <p>
                      The Problem Solvers Foundation was born from a personal moment of crisis that transformed into a vision for global change. Founded by Haniel Rolemberg, our journey began in 2017 when a routine doctor's appointment revealed his father had skin cancer—a moment that shifted everything.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      That day, Haniel realized that bad things happen to everyone, and when they do, we need to be prepared. He made a decision: to become stronger, to fight, and not freeze in the face of adversity. This personal awakening led him to leave his job as a salesman and dedicate himself to studying and building solutions that could make a real difference.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      But the journey wasn't linear. After years of working in isolation, Haniel discovered a fundamental truth: real change—deep, structural, large-scale change—only happens when people come together. When there's a team. When there's alignment. When there's shared purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This realization led him into volunteering, joining organizations like the Google Developer Group, PMI, and Rotaract. Through these experiences, he gained confidence, developed communication skills, and learned how to lead and collaborate. More importantly, he found people who, like him, were restless—wanting to use their skills for something real.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      These experiences gave him the strength to create the Problem Solvers Foundation—a community built on the belief that we are all problem solvers; we just need to be connected, organized, and empowered to act.

                    <p class="text-xl font-semibold text-black/80 dark:text-white/80">
                      By 2035, unite 1 billion people in coordinated action to become protagonists in solving the problems that define humanity's future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This isn't just a number—it's strategic. One billion people represents approximately 12% of the global population by 2035. Having 12% of people actively engaged as problem solvers in every country creates a critical mass capable of driving systemic change.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Our mission is built on a simple truth: numbers alone don't create impact—connections do. When we connect 1 billion problem solvers, we're not just adding individual contributors—we're creating something unprecedented. Using the network connection formula n×(n-1)/2, one billion connected people generate approximately 500 billion potential connections.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We're creating platforms for collaboration, systems for rapid solution deployment, and communities that turn individual passion into collective impact. We're connecting the farmer worried about drought with the engineer developing water-efficient irrigation. We're linking the teacher in an underserved community with the programmer building educational AI. We're bringing together the young activist and the experienced executive to scale solutions that work.

                      Through years of experience working both in isolation and within communities, we learned that working alone—no matter how dedicated—has limits. But when people connect around shared purpose, something exponential happens.
