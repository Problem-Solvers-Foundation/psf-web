## üéì EVALUATOR TRAINING GUIDE

### Before Starting Evaluations

**All evaluators must:**

1. **Complete calibration training** (4 hours)
   - Review scoring rubrics
   - Practice with sample applications
   - Align on what "excellence" looks like
   - Discuss unconscious bias

2. **Understand Problem Solvers values deeply**
   - Not just knowing them, but recognizing them in action
   - Examples of values in practice vs. violation

3. **Commit to the full process**
   - Cannot miss hackathon weekend
   - Must complete all assigned evaluations
   - Participate in decision meetings

---

### Evaluator Bias Training

**Common biases to watch for:**

‚ùå **Halo Effect**: One strong trait colors entire evaluation
‚ùå **Horns Effect**: One weakness colors entire evaluation
‚ùå **Similarity Bias**: Favoring candidates similar to you
‚ùå **Contrast Effect**: Comparing candidates to each other vs. standards
‚ùå **Recency Bias**: Weighing recent information more heavily
‚ùå **First Impression Bias**: Initial impression dominates
‚ùå **Confirmation Bias**: Looking for evidence that confirms initial opinion

**Mitigation strategies:**
‚úÖ Use structured rubrics consistently
‚úÖ Take detailed notes during observation
‚úÖ Score independently before discussing
‚úÖ Focus on behaviors, not personality
‚úÖ Ask: "What evidence do I have for this rating?"
‚úÖ Actively look for disconfirming evidence
‚úÖ Discuss and calibrate with other evaluators

---

### Evaluation Best Practices

**DO:**
- ‚úÖ Look for patterns of behavior across multiple situations
- ‚úÖ Weight recent evidence more than past claims
- ‚úÖ Consider growth trajectory, not just current state
- ‚úÖ Evaluate potential, not just past performance
- ‚úÖ Be specific in feedback and notes
- ‚úÖ Ask clarifying questions when uncertain
- ‚úÖ Give candidates benefit of doubt on ambiguous situations
- ‚úÖ Remember: we're looking for potential, not perfection

**DON'T:**
- ‚ùå Make snap judgments
- ‚ùå Let one bad moment define a candidate
- ‚ùå Compare candidates directly (compare to standards)
- ‚ùå Let personal preferences override criteria
- ‚ùå Rush evaluations to save time
- ‚ùå Discount candidates who challenge you
- ‚ùå Over-rely on gut feelings without evidence

---

---

## üìù CLOSING NOTES

### Philosophy of Selection

**We believe:**

‚ú® **Potential > Pedigree**: Past achievements matter, but future trajectory matters more

‚ú® **Character > Credentials**: Who you are matters more than what you've done

‚ú® **Fit > Excellence**: The best candidate is not always the "best" candidate - they must fit our culture and values

‚ú® **Diversity > Homogeneity**: Different perspectives make us stronger

‚ú® **Growth > Perfection**: We seek learners, not know-it-alls

---

### The Human Element

**Remember:**

Every candidate who reaches the hackathon is exceptional. The difference between selected and not selected is often small.

Our job is not to find perfect people - they don't exist. Our job is to find people with:
- **Clear purpose** that aligns with ours
- **Demonstrated grit** to persevere
- **Collaborative spirit** to build with others
- **Growth mindset** to evolve
- **Integrity** to do right even when hard

Selection is both art and science. Trust the process, but also trust your judgment when you see something special.
