**Join the Problem Solvers Movement**

Hello! Welcome to the Problem Solvers Foundation.

Problem Solvers is a volunteer-based movement built to unite people who want to tackle real-world problems through action, collaboration, and innovation.

We believe that meaningful change starts with individuals coming together — not to compete, but to co-create.

Our goal is to gather curious, committed, and courageous minds to imagine and build solutions that matter. There's no boss here — only direction.

The role of our leadership is to connect people, guide the first steps, and create the environment for ideas to grow and impact to happen.

If you want to be part of something bigger — and help shape the future instead of waiting for it — you're in the right place.

## 🎓 EVALUATOR TRAINING GUIDE

### Before Starting Evaluations

**All evaluators must:**

1. **Complete calibration training** (4 hours)
   - Review scoring rubrics
   - Practice with sample applications
   - Align on what "excellence" looks like
   - Discuss unconscious bias

2. **Understand Problem Solvers values deeply**
   - Not just knowing them, but recognizing them in action
   - Examples of values in practice vs. violation

3. **Commit to the full process**
   - Cannot miss hackathon weekend
   - Must complete all assigned evaluations
   - Participate in decision meetings

---

### Evaluator Bias Training

**Common biases to watch for:**

❌ **Halo Effect**: One strong trait colors entire evaluation
❌ **Horns Effect**: One weakness colors entire evaluation
❌ **Similarity Bias**: Favoring candidates similar to you
❌ **Contrast Effect**: Comparing candidates to each other vs. standards
❌ **Recency Bias**: Weighing recent information more heavily
❌ **First Impression Bias**: Initial impression dominates
❌ **Confirmation Bias**: Looking for evidence that confirms initial opinion

**Mitigation strategies:**
✅ Use structured rubrics consistently
✅ Take detailed notes during observation
✅ Score independently before discussing
✅ Focus on behaviors, not personality
✅ Ask: "What evidence do I have for this rating?"
✅ Actively look for disconfirming evidence
✅ Discuss and calibrate with other evaluators

---

### Evaluation Best Practices

**DO:**
- ✅ Look for patterns of behavior across multiple situations
- ✅ Weight recent evidence more than past claims
- ✅ Consider growth trajectory, not just current state
- ✅ Evaluate potential, not just past performance
- ✅ Be specific in feedback and notes
- ✅ Ask clarifying questions when uncertain
- ✅ Give candidates benefit of doubt on ambiguous situations
- ✅ Remember: we're looking for potential, not perfection

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Make snap judgments
- ❌ Let one bad moment define a candidate
- ❌ Compare candidates directly (compare to standards)
- ❌ Let personal preferences override criteria
- ❌ Rush evaluations to save time
- ❌ Discount candidates who challenge you
- ❌ Over-rely on gut feelings without evidence

## 📝 CLOSING NOTES

### Philosophy of Selection

**We believe:**

✨ **Potential > Pedigree**: Past achievements matter, but future trajectory matters more

✨ **Character > Credentials**: Who you are matters more than what you've done

✨ **Fit > Excellence**: The best candidate is not always the "best" candidate - they must fit our culture and values

✨ **Diversity > Homogeneity**: Different perspectives make us stronger

✨ **Growth > Perfection**: We seek learners, not know-it-alls

---

### The Human Element

**Remember:**

Every candidate who reaches the hackathon is exceptional. The difference between selected and not selected is often small.

Our job is not to find perfect people - they don't exist. Our job is to find people with:
- **Clear purpose** that aligns with ours
- **Demonstrated grit** to persevere
- **Collaborative spirit** to build with others
- **Growth mindset** to evolve
- **Integrity** to do right even when hard

Selection is both art and science. Trust the process, but also trust your judgment when you see something special.
